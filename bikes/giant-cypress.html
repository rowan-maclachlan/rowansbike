    <p>Where did this bike come from?</p>

    <h2>The Upgrades</h2>
    <p>Was anything done to this bike?  The seat was replaced with a Norca
    Giant seat - one which was far more _ of a forward-facing, athletic posture
    than what was there before.  When the seat and seatpost was stolen, it had
    to be replaced again.</p>
