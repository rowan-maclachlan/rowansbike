    <h2>The Origin</h2>
    <div class="dividor-bottom"></div>
    <div class="bike-content">
      <p>Rowan got this bike... for his 16th birthday?  And he's still using
      it!</p>
    </div>
      
    <div class="dividor-top"></div>
    <h2>The Upgrades</h2>
    <div class="dividor-bottom"></div>
      
    <div class="bike-content">
      <p>Less has been done on this that on Rowan's <a href="../bikes/cambio-rino.html">Cambio
          Rino</a>, but there have been a few major changes. The first of these
        was the replacement of the broken <a href="https://www.sheldonbrown.com/upgrade-gears.html#twist">grip</a> shifters (shifters prone to wearing
        out) with a pair of trigger shifters found at the Bridge City Bike
        Coop. This alone represented a huge upgrade.</p>
      
      <p>The next was the replacement
      of the front shocks.  The stock shocks were a cheap make, and couldn't be
      serviced.  After several years of rough riding around Saskatoon's streets as a young boy and the
      typical disinterest in the bike's proper maintenance, the shocks had siezed become quite and unreponsive.  
      One day, I was walking past the church (The Redeemed Christian Church of God) on
      the corner of Eastlake and 12th Street when I noticed a pair of
      front shocks sitting on a table that said "Free Stuff."  I could hardly
      believe it!  Upon closer inspection, I  discovered that I had
      happened upon a pair of used RockShox Toras.  Although the Toras
      are one of RockShox lower tiers, they represented a huge upgrade over
      the practically unusable shocks which were on the KHS at the time.</p>
      
      <p>The installation of these RockShox, though, would lead to more
      work that I had originally planed.  The KHS came with cantilever brakes, but the
      new fork had no braze-ons for the brakes the bike came with.
      Instead, it had a mount for a disk brake.  About $175 later, I retrieved
      a new wheel, new tire, and new disk brake and disk brake mount adapter
      from Bike Universe on 20th.  These, combined with the new fork,
      constituted significantly upgrades to the overall quality of the ride while at the same
      time expanding my experience with front suspension forks, disk brakes, and this
      type of upgrade generally.</p>
      
      <p>The shox were ridden for a winter to school, and did a great job.  However, I was concerned about their condition because I did not know the previous owners of the shocks or how they had been treated.  I resolved to attempt to service them myself.  I picked up some light shock oil from the BikeDoctor and got them to order me in a new set of fork seals.  After reading through the service manuals (see <a href="https://www.sram.com/service/rockshox/7,105">here</a> and checking out some Youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmehC5MJDHE">videos</a>, I proceeded through an upper fork service.  It seems to have worked well and I can be confident now about their state.</p>

    <h2>The Future</h2>
    <div class="dividor-bottom"></div>
    
    <div class="bike-content">
      <p>Hopefully, this bike can be sold to someone more interested in putting it through it's paces rather than sitting in a garage or just riding around town.  Though it had been neglected in the past, it has always deserved to be ridden down the single track in the Saskatoon river valley, gotten muddy, gotten cleaned, and taken care of.  Now that its been upgraded and serviced properly, its more ready than ever for some excitement.</p>
