    <h1>The KHS Alite 100</h1>
    <h2>The Origin</h2>
      <p>Rowan got this bike... for his 16th birthday?  And he's still using
      it!</p>

    <h2>The Upgrades</h2>
      <p>Less has been done on this that on Rowan's <a href="../bikes/cambio-rino.html">Cambio
      Rino</a>, but there have been a few major changes.  The first of these
    was the replacement of the broken grip shifters (shifter prone to wearing
    out) with a pair of used trigger shifters found at the Bridge City Bike
    Coop.  This alone represented a huge upgrade.  The next was the replacement
      of the front shocks.  The stock shocks were a cheap make, and couldn't be
      services.  After several years of rough riding as a boy and the
      accompanying disinterest in its proper maintenance, the shocks had becomd
      quite siezed and unreponsive.  One day, I was walking past the church on
      the corner of Eastlake and 12th Street East when I noticed a pair of
      front shocks sitting on a table that said "Free Stuff".  I could hardly
      believe it!  Upon closer inspection, Rowan  discovered that he had simply
      happened upon a pair of lightly used RockShox Toras.  Although the Toras
      are one of RockShox lower tiers, they represented a huge upgrade over
      the practically unusable shocks which were on the KHS at the time.</p>
      <p>The installation of these RockShox, though, would lead to much more
      work that I had originally planed.  The KHS came with rim brakes, but the
      new fork had no mounts for the cantilever brakes the bike came with.
      Instead, it had a mount for a disk brake.  About $175 later, I retrieved
      a new wheel, new tire, and new disk brake and disk brake mount adapter
      from Bike Universe on 20th.  These, combined with the new fork,
      significantly upgrades the overall quality of the ride while at the same
      time expanding my experience with front suspension, disk brakes, and this
      type of upgrade generally.</p>
