<p>I got this bike from a friend after helping her with her upgrade (a bike
that actually fit!)  Although this bike isn't anything special, its larger
frame was the perfect fit for another much taller friend of mine.  These raised
handlebars were likely not original - a pair of drop bars were kept apart from
the bike, and later donated to the local co-op.  Altogether, though, this bike
has a particular appeal to me as a light-weight bar-beater and casual-commuter
bicycle.</p>
