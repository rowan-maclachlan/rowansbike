<p>I found this bike in his neighbour's garage, sometime in the Spring or
Summer of 2016.  I had just had my other bike stolen - a heavy
Norco 21-speed commuter with shocks, flat bars, trigger shifters, and a big
cushy seat.  How it was stolen is a story for another time, though.</p>
<p>This bike was in bad condition when I found it.  Although it was stored inside
a garage when I got it, it had obviously been left out in the elements at too
many point during its life.  It had some cool camo bartape which was flayed
and falling apart - covering up badly rusted and ugly little steel drop bars.
Its center-pull brakes were not rusted away, but they were covered in dirt and
grime.  The brake levers featured some clunky and uninspiring skull-brakes.  At
the time, I didn't even know these existed.  The tires were the
only non-original part on the bike when I got it - cheap 27x1 1/4" Pneu Vee
tires with the vomit-tan sidewalls.  The rims were cheap garbage: they
were out of true when I got it, but I was never able to get them to stay true.
In hindsight, I think they may have just needed a complete rebuilding.
Even though this period was the beginning of my education as a mechanic, I have
never before seen rims of such poor quality.  They felt as though they could
have been cut in half with a butter knife.  The seat and seatpost, too, were
cheap.  They had the old style of seat clamp, and the post was a mere 6" deep.
It was thoroughly rusted into the seat-tube, and it took ages and the greater
part of a can of WD-40 to get it loose.  It had a couple of cheap stem-shifters
with some broken friction adjusters, too.  In many ways, its a small miracle
the frame has been repurposed with such care and attention as it was.</p>
