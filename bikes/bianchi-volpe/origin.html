<p>The project bike that I worked on with my good friend Jack.  The frame I had
noticed sitting around at the local co-op for several months, wishing it fit me
so I could put it to use.  When Jack suggested we get a bike for his partner, I
agreed to accompany him to the co-op and help him pick something out.  When we
couldn't find anything suitable which was worth fixing up (and worthy, in
Jack's mind, of his partner,) I suggested we take this nice frame and just put
a little more sweat into making it worthwhile.  Jack, knowing this would be a
great learning opportunity, jumped at the suggestion.  We left the co-op with
the frame, a sadde, a quill stem, and two decent looking aluminum rims.</p>
