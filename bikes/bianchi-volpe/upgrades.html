<p>The frame in question was small, but seemed to me to be of good quality.  It
was exceptionally light, but felt sturdy regardless.  I remember seeing
somewhere on the frame the indication that it was a chromoly steel frame.  I
did some research on the thing too, but wouldn't have discovered much without
Sheldon Brown's great article on it <a href="https://www.sheldonbrown.com/volpe.html">here.</a>
There was a fork on the frame when Jack and I picked it up, but I don't think
it was original because it felt very heavy and the paint job didn't match.  We
kept it on regardless.</p>
<p>As I said before, Jack and I left the co-op with a few parts to get things
started.  We found a cartridge square-taper bottom bracket, some cantilever
brakes, a 1" quill stem, thumb shifters, break levers, and a pair of 27"
wheels. Everything else we needed I already had at home, including a nice
ritchey flat bar.  The 27" wheels were probably the nicest ones at the co-op,
but some 700c or 26" wheels would have been more suited to the geometry of the bicycle
and its future rider.</p>
<p>After a couple false starts with incorrectly sized seat-posts (this Bianchi
had an unusual size, and we had to buy a seatpost new instead of being able to
find a suitable post from the 'used' bucket at the co-op,) quill stems of
various heights, and a pair of cantis that didn't turn, we built the whole
thing up.  I taught Jack how to disassemble, clean, and reassemble wheel hubs,
and he did a full service on them.  He routed all the new cabling and cable
housing, installed the new crankset, derailleurs, freewheel, and chain, and
generally assembled the whole thing.  At the end of it, it had a bit of a goofy
appearance, but it rode nicely.</p>
