<p>While I think Jack's girlfriend is enjoying the bicycle like it is, the
frame really has a lot more potential than what its set up for right now.
While all the components we used to build it up were used and not of
exceptionally good quality, I would not bother with many of them before taking
care of a few other, greater goals.  This bike was designed as a cyclocross
bike, and it should be treated more like one.  It really deserves a modernized
drive train with drop bars.  The wheelset needs to be swapped out for something
with a freehub and 8 or 10 speeds, a double crankset should be installed, and
some STI brake levers should be installed with a nice new alloy drop bar and aqua
blue handlebar warp to match the paint job.  Then, some nice new tan-wall tyres
can get thrown on to complete the look.  We'll see what the new owner does in
the future!</p>
