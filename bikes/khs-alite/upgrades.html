<p>The bike got pretty abused when I was a child, and after I got another bike,
I let it languish in the shed for some time.  But when I started getting
into working on my own bikes (and taking care of my belongings generally,) I
took it out of the shed to see what I could do.  This was the bike with which I first
learned about adjusting indexed shifting, and who's square taper bottom bracket
I first dealt with.  I gave the whole thing a good wash and scraped off as much
rust from the various components as I could.  All the hubs I serviced, and I
replaced the freewheel and chain.  A bit of new rubber and some used trigger
shifters, and then I very proud of the transformation that had taken place.</p>
      
<p>The biggest difference was made with the replacement
of the front shocks.  The stock shocks were cheap shit, and couldn't be
serviced.  After several years of around Saskatoon's streets as a young boy and the
typical disinterest in the bike's proper maintenance, the shocks had siezed become quite and unreponsive.  
One day, I was walking past the church (The Redeemed Christian Church of God) on
the corner of Eastlake and 12th Street when I noticed a pair of
front shocks sitting on a table that said "Free Stuff."  I could hardly
believe it!  Upon closer inspection, I  discovered that I had
happened upon a pair of used RockShox Toras.  Although the Toras
are one of RockShox lower tiers, they represented a huge upgrade over
the practically unusable shocks which were on the KHS at the time.</p>

<p>The installation of these RockShox, though, would lead to more
work that I had originally planed.  The KHS came with v-brakes, but the
new fork had no braze-ons for the brakes already mounted on the old fork.
Instead, it had a mount for a disk brake.  About $175 later, I retrieved
a new wheel, new tire, and new disk brake and disk brake mount adapter
from Bike Universe on 20th.  These, combined with the new fork,
constituted significantly upgrades to the overall quality of the ride while at the same
time expanding my experience with front suspension forks, disk brakes, and this
type of upgrade generally.</p>

<p>The shox were ridden for a winter to school, and did a great job.
However, I was concerned about their condition because I did not know the
previous owners of the shocks or how they had been treated.  I resolved
to attempt to service them myself.  I picked up some light shock oil from
the BikeDoctor and got them to order me in a new set of fork seals.
After reading through the service manuals (see <a class="link-trans"
href="https://www.sram.com/service/rockshox/7,105">here</a> and checking
out some Youtube <a class="link-trans"

proceeded through an upper fork service.  It seems to have worked well
and I can be confident now about their state.</p>
