<p>This is the second bike I ever owned.  Purchased from Bike Universe in
Saskatoon, it was pretty run of the mill.  The Alite line had a few variations
(300, 500), and this was the lowest tier.  Despite the low-tier stock grip
shifters and the un-servicable front fork, the frame has always been amenable
to upgrades.  A new cockpit, new front wheel, and new RockShox Tora front fork
are a few of the upgrades this bike has received over the years.</p>
