<p>This is the second bike I ever owned.  Purchased from Bike Universe in
Saskatoon, it was a good little beater for kid riding around town and up and
down the little trails along the river valley with his friends.  The Alite line
had a few variations (300, 500), and this was the lowest tier.  It came
outfitted with Shimano Tourney grip shifters and drive-train, and an
un-servicable front fork, but the frame has always been amenable to upgrades.
A new cockpit, new front wheel, and new RockShox Tora front fork are a few of
the upgrades this bike has received over the years.</p>
