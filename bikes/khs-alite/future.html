<p>Hopefully, this bike will be owned by someone more interested in putting it
through it's paces than letting it sit in a garage or just be ridden around
city streets.  Though it had been neglected in the past, it has always deserved
to be taken down all the single track in the Saskatoon river valley, gotten
muddy, gotten cleaned, and been care of.  Now that its been upgraded and
serviced properly, its more ready than ever for some excitement.</p>
<p>In Spring 2019, it was sold at a used bicycle auction put on by Saskatoon
Cycles (a community organization) for $250.  This recouped the greater part of
the costs associated with its upgrades, and it will probably do better than to
be used only on the salty winter roads I was taking it on.</p>
