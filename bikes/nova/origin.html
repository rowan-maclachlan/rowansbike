<p>An nice looking old bike whose history and origin I have been unable to
learn. This <q>Nova</q>, with its cottered steel crank arms and black/gold
colourscheme I think looks excellent with its clean new cockpit and polished
aluminum down-tube shifters.  It also features a pair of gorgeous French-made
Rigidex steel rims that shine in the sun (after a fair it of work with
sandpaper and polish.)</p>
