What is this site about?
========================

This website represents a personal project for me and a sandbox in which to
develop basic web programming skills.  None of the work in here done by me
should be considered exemplary or excellent in any regard, unless judged so on
its own merit alone.  

In addition to serving as a bit of a playground for my software engineering
side, it also features some content created by my physical engineering side.
The content on bicycle work and repair may be of interest to other enthusiasts.  

The site also features a blog in which I recount parts of my 27 day bicycle
tour from Saskatoon to Vancouver.  This was published not only for posterity's
sake but also for the sake of other prospective or aspiring tourists, and to
contribute to the record of touring routes through Western Canada.  

Can I participate?
------------------
If you want, sure.

How does it work?
-----------------
The web host will automatically deploy when it recieved a push notification
from Git.

If something needs to be changed with the content managed by the headless CMS
used for the blog (<a href="https://www.couchcms.com/">couchCMS</a>), someone with the PHPmyadmin and database
credentials will need to manage it.
